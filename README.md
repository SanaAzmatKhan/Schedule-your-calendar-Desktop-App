This is a desktop application built on:
SQL server & 
C#
User can add & update his personal, meetings, appointments and events for himself. A reminder will popup, at selected time before the event, to remind user about the schedule.
An attractive UI, and C# at the backend makes this app ineteresting, I guess. 
Anyone can collaborate to my this experiment, because its incomplete yet...
#It is Just a learning project.
